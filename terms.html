This Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing) represents the complete agreement between you and IIL concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of Florida without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and Florida law, rules, and regulations, Florida law, rules and regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Naples, Florida. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.Any notices to IIL must be sent to: Investment Innovation LLC, 4734 Stratford Court, # 1702, Naples FL 34105, via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights in this Agreement without IIL's prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. The relationship between IIL and you is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The following sections of this Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1, 4, 5, 6 (except the last two sentences), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>

You have permission from InvestmentInnovation LLC to view the website and its content and make copies of the content displayed on this website for viewing through the normal operation of your web browser or for printouts that may be considered "fair use" under applicable copyright laws. All other rights are reserved by InvestmentInnovation LLC. IIL trademarks and service marks displayed on this website are exclusively owned by IIL. IIL provides access to this website and its contents on an "as is" and "as available" basis. IIL and its licensors specifically disclaim any representations, warranties, and conditions, whether express or implied, including, without limitation, any representations, warranties or conditions (a) of accuracy, completeness, title, noninfringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or (b) arising from usage in any trade or from any course of dealing. We may make changes to the information on this website at and time without prior notice to you. IIL does not provide investment advice or advocate the purchase or sale of any security or investment. You should always seek the assistance of a professional for investment advice. Performance figures contained herein are hypothetical, unaudited and prepared by Investment Innovation LLC; hypothetical results are intended for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results, which may vary. There is a risk of substantial loss associated with trading commodities, futures, options and other financial instruments. Before trading, investors should carefully consider their financial position and risk tolerance to determine if the proposed trading style is appropriate. Investors should realize that when trading futures, commodities and/or granting/writing options one could lose the full balance of their account. It is also possible to lose more than the initial deposit when trading futures and/or granting/writing options. All funds committed to such a trading strategy should be purely risk capital. Hypothetical performance results (e.g., quantitative backtests) have many inherent limitations, some of which, but not all, are described herein. No representation is being made that any fund or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown herein. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently realized by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can adversely affect actual trading results. The hypothetical performance results contained herein represent the application of the quantitative models as currently in effect on the date first written above and there can be no assurance that the models will remain the same in the future or that an application of the current models in the future will produce similar results because the relevant market and economic conditions that prevailed during the hypothetical performance period will not necessarily recur. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results, all of which can adversely affect actual trading results. Hypothetical performance results are presented for illustrative purposes only. Indexes are unmanaged, do not reflect management or trading fees, and one cannot invest directly in an index. There is no guarantee, express or implied, that long-term return and/or volatility targets will be achieved. Realized returns and/or volatility may come in higher or lower than expected.&nbsp;</p></div>
