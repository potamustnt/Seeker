When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process Customer Data only on IIL's instructions and in compliance with this Agreement and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>7. Privacy.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">You will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the Service to track, collect or upload any data that personally identifies an individual (such as a name, email address or billing information), or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by IIL. You will have and abide by an appropriate Privacy Policy and will comply with all applicable laws, policies, and regulations relating to the collection of information from Visitors. You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of your use of cookies that are used to collect data.

You must not circumvent any privacy features (e.g., an opt-out) that are part of the Service.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>8. Indemnification.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">To the extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, hold harmless and defend IIL and its wholly owned subsidiaries, at your expense, from any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against IIL or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by IIL or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to (i) your breach of any term or condition of this Agreement, (ii) your use of the Service, (iii) your violations of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Service, (iv) any representations and warranties made by you concerning any aspect of the Service, the Software or Reports to any Third Party; (v) any claims made by or on behalf of any Third Party pertaining directly or indirectly to your use of the Service, the Software or Reports; (vi) violations of your obligations of privacy to any Third Party; and (vii) any claims with respect to acts or omissions of any Third Party in connection with the Service, the Software or Reports. IIL will provide you with written notice of any claim, suit or action from which you must indemnify IIL. You will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. IIL reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>9. Third Parties.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">If you use the Service on behalf of the Third Party or a Third Party otherwise uses the Service through your Account, whether or not you are authorized by IIL to do so, then you represent and warrant that (a) you are authorized to act on behalf of, and bind to this Agreement, the Third Party to all obligations that you have under this Agreement, (b) IIL may share with the Third Party any Customer Data that is specific to the Third Party's Properties, and (c) you will not disclose Third Party's Customer Data to any other party without the Third Party's consent.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>10.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IIL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR YOUR LOST REVENUES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF IIL OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF, KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF DIRECT DAMAGES DO NOT SATISFY A REMEDY. IIL'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $500 (USD).&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>13. Proprietary Rights Notice.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">The Service, which includes the Software and all Intellectual Property Rights therein are, and will remain, the property of IIL (and its wholly owned subsidiaries). All rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved and retained by IIL and its licensors without restriction, including, IIL's (and its wholly owned subsidiaries') right to sole ownership of the Software and Documentation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree not to (and not to allow any third party to): (a) sublicense, distribute, or use the Service or Software outside of the scope of the license granted in this Agreement; (b) copy, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Software or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or trade secrets related to the Service; (c) rent, lease, sell, assign or otherwise transfer rights in or to the Software or the Service; (d) use, post, transmit or introduce any device, software or routine which interferes or attempts to interfere with the operation of the Service or the Software; (e) use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features or any copyright or other proprietary rights associated with the Service for any purpose without the express written consent of IIL; (f) register, attempt to register, or assist anyone else to register any trademark, trade name, serve marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features, copyright or other proprietary rights associated with IIL other than in the name of IIL; (g) remove, obscure, or alter any notice of copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right appearing in or on any item included with the Service; or (h) seek, in a proceeding filed during the term of this Agreement or for one year after such term, an injunction of any portion of the Service based on patent infringement.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>14. U.S. Government Rights.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">If the use of the Service is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions), the Government's rights in the Software, including its rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display or disclose the Software or Documentation, will be subject in all respects to the commercial license rights and restrictions provided in this Agreement.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>15. Term and Termination.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice. Upon any termination of this Agreement, IIL will stop providing, and you will stop accessing the Service. In the event of termination by IIL you will be entitled to a refund reflecting the residual days of your current license term. In the event of termination by you, you will not be entitled to any refunds of any usage or other fees, and any outstanding balance for Service rendered through the date of termination, will be immediately due and payable in full.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>16. Modifications to Terms of Service and Other Policies.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">IIL may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to the Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Service. You should look at the terms regularly. IIL will post notice of modifications to these terms at the IIL Website. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 14 days after they are posted. If you do not agree to the modified terms for the Service, you should discontinue your use of IIL Service. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement will be binding unless (i) in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of IILe, (ii) you accept updated terms online, or (iii) you continue to use the Service after IIL has posted updates to the Agreement or to any policy governing the Service.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>17. Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Venue.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">IIL will be excused from performance in this Agreement to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control. This Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing) represents the complete agreement between you and IIL concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of Florida without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and Florida law, rules, and regulations, Florida law, rules and regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Naples, Florida. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.Any notices to IIL must be sent to: Investment Innovation LLC, 4734 Stratford Court, # 1702, Naples FL 34105, via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights in this Agreement without IIL's prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. The relationship between IIL and you is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The following sections of this Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1, 4, 5, 6 (except the last two sentences), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>DISCLAIMER FOR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY INVESTMENT INNOVATION LLC</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">The website and its content are copyrighted works of IIL and/or its licensors.

You should always seek the assistance of a professional for investment advice. Performance figures contained herein are hypothetical, unaudited and prepared by Investment Innovation LLC; hypothetical results are intended for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results, which may vary. There is a risk of substantial loss associated with trading commodities, futures, options and other financial instruments. Before trading, investors should carefully consider their financial position and risk tolerance to determine if the proposed trading style is appropriate. Investors should realize that when trading futures, commodities and/or granting/writing options one could lose the full balance of their account. It is also possible to lose more than the initial deposit when trading futures and/or granting/writing options. All funds committed to such a trading strategy should be purely risk capital. Hypothetical performance results (e.g., quantitative backtests) have many inherent limitations, some of which, but not all, are described herein. No representation is being made that any fund or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown herein. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently realized by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can adversely affect actual trading results. The hypothetical performance results contained herein represent the application of the quantitative models as currently in effect on the date first written above and there can be no assurance that the models will remain the same in the future or that an application of the current models in the future will produce similar results because the relevant market and economic conditions that prevailed during the hypothetical performance period will not necessarily recur. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results, all of which can adversely affect actual trading results. Hypothetical performance results are presented for illustrative purposes only. Indexes are unmanaged, do not reflect management or trading fees, and one cannot invest directly in an index.

We give an example, in ‘Using Seeker’, where we correlated the Healthcare sector with itself in 2015; while some stocks track perfectly, a large number show no relationship at all! &nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">In addition to single pairs of stocks, indexes, ETFs or portfolios, Seeker processes groups of hundreds, at very high speed, so that it can analyze entire industries to find opportunities in seconds.

It takes seconds to analyze.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Correlation is primarily a tool for finding linear relationships: correlation does not prove causality, but as Seeker correlates on closing prices, finding that the prices of two entities follow each other with 90%+ correlation is remarkable, and you will find many that do. Our “Technical” tab discusses the significance of correlation coefficients.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Sector analysis identifies a corporation with a single group identity that is usually based on its history. Because correlation is based on actual performance, it offers an alternative to sector analysis. We show two examples below:</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">At the end of section (1) Period Analysis, we show how correlating a sector with itself exposes wide disparities in performance.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>the second, in (4) Portfolio Style Analysis, shows how correlating with stock sector and index groups can provide an analysis of style change over time in relation to 1,500 indexes, 10 sector groups and 38 index groups.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Seeker’s main features are data integrity and performance. Data integrity enables it to handle source data that may include input errors and gaps. Speed enables makes it very responsive, which increases analyst productivity, and to analyze entire industries.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">The standard system contains 2,900 stocks, 1,500 indexes, 1,300 ETF's, 10 stock sector groups, and 38 index groups that include index owners, like “Wilshire”; types, like “Growth”, industry and others.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Seeker users work in their own data space; they can upload their own stock and index groups, watch lists, and portfolios, and can even base their correlation on different data sets, if required.</span></p>",

          "text": "<p>Seeker's first option is period analysis. A “Target” is defined that can be selected from a dropdown list that is displayed when you enter a stock, ETF, index or portfolio or, it can be entered as a single symbol, or a comma-delimited string of symbols. Seeker gives preference to manually entered items, so if there are some displayed, they override the dropdown selection. A “Match” option to compare with the Target is similarly defined. Seeker pairs, and analyzes, every possible combination of Target and Match entered, which can comprise thousands of combinations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;A timescale is defined that can cover any period within the Earliest and Latest Dates. Seeker calculates the overall correlation, but also lets you select Sub-intervals, which allow you to evaluate granularity over shorter periods. Finally, the results are sorted, and you can select an ascending sort (for positive correlation) or descending (for negative correlation) and choose the column that you want to sort. Data entry: if you target \"Stocks\", for example, a drop down list displays a list of sector groups. Users can build and upload their own watchlists that are displayed as part of this group. Or, users can type in a comma delimited list of stock, or index tickers, which is convenient for doing one-off comparisons. When the correlation analysis is complete the user can select alpha (ratio of the interval gain in closing price gain for the Target divided by that of the Matches) , or beta (ratio of the interval standard deviations of the Target, divided by that of the Matches. The results are shown in the same order in which they were correlated to make comparison easier.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

For example, SPNC/DJVG had a correlation coefficient of 0.91 when they were analyzed at the same time, but when DJV6 is advanced by 21 trading days (1 month) the correlation coefficient rises to 0.96. NOTE that each of the examples on the page shows the pairs with the highest correlation out of several thousand, This shows less variability than appears lower down the tables! Consequently a difference of 5% for SPNC/DJVG is unlikely to be worth evaluating, but if the gap is larger, it may be worth inserting the pair into a Period Analysis to examine them further, or to set up the analysis over a longerperiod to see if it becomes stronger. The grid is currently sorted by the offset that gives the highest correlation.</p><p><br></p>",

The output is identical to Phase Analysis, except that when an entity is correlated against itself, the correlation coefficient must be 1.0 at zero offset, as you can see. In autocorrelation we are looking for cyclical behavior, which would be seen if correlation increased or decreased with the phase advance. As you can see, CR appears to be in the top row, IO's correlation with itself falls from 0.98 to 0.02 at 315 days(15 months) and rises to 0.93 at 441 days. As with the phase offset, correlating intervals can be analyzed further with Period Analysis, or by extending the time scale to 10 years.</p><p><br></p><p>Autocorrelation has two additional features: (1) if you want to see the members of a group, autocorrelating the group will list its members. (2) Autocorrelation lists the full name of an entity alongside its ticker; if you are unsure of a symbol name autocorrelating it will show the full hane.</p><p><br></p>",

          "text": "<p>Correlation allows you to measure two investment entities, a pair of tocks, or a stock and an index, or a stock and an ETF, or two portfolios over time. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates that they are perfectly matched: 0 indicates that they have no relationship; -1 indicates that they move in opposite directions to each other.</p><p> </p><p>In returns-based style analysis, correlation can be useful by allowing comparison between portfolios and indexes, for example. Indexes are defined in terms of their market composition, and if a portfolio can be correlated with an index, then the portfolio may be characterized by it and have an exposure in similar markets. This is where returns-based analysis differs from holdings-based analysis; it is defined by behavior rather than the consituent stocks.</p><p>Many investors like to use sectors to identify investments that they believe will move together in market changes; the difficulty is that today's conglomerates are in so many markets! Correlation matches stocks not on a historical definition of their business, but on actual performance. Our comparison of the healthcare market in 'Using Seeker' illustrates how diverse sector performance is!</p><p>Seeker correlates combinations of entities over an time period within its data range, but also breaks the period into subintervals so that you can see how correlation changed over the period, with a statistical summary of the changes.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>if you want to find a stock that matches your portfolio, or to see if it really only matches an index, or you are looking for a match in a past market period, correlation is very effective, but it has other properties. If you advance the timing of one of the two entities you are researching,, and you find that they match better when one of them is advanced, you might have an index or stock that is a leading indicator. Seeker lets you investigate offsets of up to 2 years, and you can run a comparison of your favorite stock against all 1600 indexes in seconds to find out. </p><p>A final feature of correlation is autocorrelation in which you correlate a stock or index with itself, and change the timing. If you find that the correlation improves if one is advanced then you have an entity that is cyclical, and so its performance can be predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeker processes approximately 40,000 correlations/second, so it responds while you are still thinking.

This analysis depends on defining which factors might be useful, and on data that enables us to isolate their effects. </p><p>There are a number of factor models; Seeker uses the Fama-French model developed by Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French at the University of Chicago. This 3-factor model originated from the observation that all stocks tend to benefit from a rising tide; that small cap stocks grow faster than large caps; and that value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks over time.&nbsp;</p><p>The resulting research at the University of Chicago produced a linear definition of performance in which the contribution of the factors could be isolated, and a library of historical data that measures the performance over time of stocks that reflect each factor. The model and the data enable the performance of a portfolio to be analyzed over time to measure how much of a contribution each factor may have provided. </p><p>The original 3-factor model was enhanced to 5 in 2015, and Seeker supports both. </p><p>The analysis provides </p><ul><li>the annualized excess gain over the risk free investment rate.</li><li>an overall measurement of the extent to which the performance of the portfolio can be attributed to the factors, The remainder is a measurement of the manager's skill.</li><li> the weighting to be applied to each factor, </li><li>the \"standard error\" for each weighting to measure how consistent the analysis is, </li><li>the probability that the weighting is significant (typically around 95%).</li></ul><p>So what are the factors? Their names are cryptic - in the 3-factor model they are:</p><ul><li>RmMrfr&nbsp; &nbsp; the Return (monthly) of the portfolio Minus the \"risk free rate\" (of short-term Treasuries). Measures sensitivity to the market as a whole.</li><li>SMB&nbsp; &nbsp; Small cap Minus Big&nbsp;cap. Measures sensitivity to small caps.</li><li>&nbsp;HML&nbsp; &nbsp;High Minus Low. Measures high book to price (Value) minus low (Growth)</li></ul><p>In 5 factor analysis, the additional factors are\"</p><ul><li>RMW&nbsp; &nbsp; Robust profitability Minus Weak.&nbsp;</li><li>CMA&nbsp; &nbsp; Conservative Minus Aggressive approachour equities to investment in the US.</li></ul><p> </p><p>The result of the analysis shows R2, a measurement of the extent tothe &nbsp;which performance can be attributed to the factors (the remainder being a reflection of management skill). Then for each factor, plus the gain, it shows the weighting for each factor that was optimal; the standard error (similar to a standard deviation of the weighting); and the statistical significance of the result for the factor, measured as the percentage probability that the contribution of the factor is not random.</p><p>Because Seeker supports analysis on large groups, you can run factor analysis on the entire Wilshire 5000, in seconds, and sort the results by the factors, to see the populations that match each.&nbsp;</p>",

Correlation matches stocks not on a historical definition of their business, but on actual performance. Our comparison of the healthcare market in 'Using Seeker' illustrates how diverse sector performance is! </p><p>if you want to find a stock that matches your portfolio, or to see if it really only matches an index, or you are looking for a match in a past market period, correlation is very effective, but it has other properties. If you advance the timing of one of the two entities you are researching,, and you find that they match better when one of them is advanced, you might have an index or stock that is a leading indicator. Seeker lets you investigate offsets of up to 2 years, and you can run a comparison of your favorite stock against all 1600 indexes in seconds to find out. </p><p>A final feature of correlation is autocorrelation in which you correlate a stock or index with itself, and change the timing. If you find that the correlation improves if one is advanced then you have an entity that is cyclical, and so its performance can be predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeker processes approximately 40,000 correlations/second, so it responds while you are still thinking.

Relative gain is the ratio of closing price at the end of the interval to closing price on the first day, divided by the same ratio for the Comparison stock or index. Note that high ratios can occur when the Comparison is a large index with a very small change in price over the period. </p><p>Relative volatility is the standard deviation of the Target over the interval divided by that of the Comparison. Note that very high ratios can occur when comparing to a large index fund which has a standard deviation close to zero.</p>",
