When you use ticker or index groups, they are unambiguous but when you enter a stock ticker, Seeker processes all entities that match that symbol at any point in the data history. This may lead to output in which the symbols are listed but no correlations occur in the period you have selected, leading to empty records.</p><p>To find out which ticker symbols are contained in a stock or index group, select the group as a Target, and run Autocorrelation, which lists both the stock tickers and their full names.</p><p>Analysis is divided into subintervals to show how overall correlation might vary over shorter periods. This occurs because the correlation coefficient includes not only the product of the two variables being compared; it is divided by their standard deviations which, if it is small, can produce large swings in correlation. Standard deviations also become more volatile when the sample size is small, and we recommend not using intervals of less than a month (20 trading days). </p><p>In order to help understand the variability in interval performance we present a group of measurements.

You may notice that some pairs correlate very well overall, but show a wide difference in standard deviation over subintervals.

A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates that they are perfectly matched: 0 indicates that they have no relationship; -1 indicates that they move in opposite directions to each other.</p><p> </p><p>In returns-based style analysis, correlation can be useful by allowing comparison between portfolios and indexes, for example. Indexes are defined in terms of their market composition, and if a portfolio can be correlatied with an index, then the index can characterize it.</p><p>Many investors like to use sectors to identify investments that they believe will move together in market changes; the difficulty is that today's conglomerates are in so many markets! Correlation matches stocks not on a historical definition of their business, but on actual performance. Our comparison of the healthcare market in 'Using Seeker' illustrates how diverse sector performance is! </p><p>if you want to find a stock that matches your portfolio, or to see if it really only matches an index, or you are looking for a match in a past market period, correlation is very effective, but it has other properties. If you advance the timing of one of the two entities you are researching,, and you find that they match better when one of them is advanced, you might have an index or stock that is a leading indicator. Seeker lets you investigate offsets of up to 2 years, and you can run a comparison of your favorite stock against all 1600 indexes in seconds to find out. </p><p>A final feature of correlation is autocorrelation in which you correlate a stock or index with itself, and change the timing. If you find that the correlation improves if one is advanced then you have an entity that is cyclical, and so its performance can be predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeker processes approximately 40,000 correlations/second, so it responds while you are still thinking. Very productive!</p></div>

We refer to both as ρ in this discussion). ρ varies between +1, indicating perfect correlation; 0, reflecting no correlaton; and -1 indicating that the two distributions move orthogonally. It is calculated as follows (for reference see Pearson product-moment) and related Wikipedia articles that discuss interpretation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ρ = (Exy-(Ex*Ey))/(σx * σy) where Ex = expected value of x = (1/N)∑xi etc; xi, yi are matched pairs of data points at the same date, and N is the count of each.</p><p>σ is the standard deviation of xi or yi calculated by using Welford's formula for the variance calculated as</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;σ^2 = (1/(N*(N-1)))*[ n*Sum (xi^2) - (Sum xi)^2]&nbsp;</p><p>Covariance and correlation coefficients are calculated using N.</p><p>The regression used for factor analysis calculates a linear relationship between the factors, and the expected return over the risk-free-rate, R where&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R = F0 + F1*RmMRfr + F2*SMB + F3*HML adding, in the 5 factor case F4*RMW + F5*CMA where F0 represents alpha, and F2 etc represent the coefficients of the factors.</p><p>It can be seen that F0 represents the expected return when all the factors are zero, and that F1, for example, represents the change expected from a 1 unit change in RmMPfr, etc. The signs of the coefficients is important, indicating whether R changes in the same direction as a given factor.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeker outputs the R2, the fraction of the variation in the result that is accounted for by the independent factors. Generally more important are the coefficients, their Standard Errors (equivalent to the standard deviation on their values), and the Probability, which measures the likelihood that the coefficient could not be zero i.e. its significance. The statistical analysis measures the assumed relationship against the possibility that the coefficients could be zero. The Probabilities show the probability that the factor coefficients are valid, and not zero: 95% is usually regarded as a solid indicator.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
